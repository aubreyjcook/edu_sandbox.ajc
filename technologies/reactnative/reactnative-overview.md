# React Native Overview

React Native is a JavaScript framework for building native mobile applications. It allows developers to write mobile applications using JavaScript and React, and then compile the code to native code for iOS and Android platforms. React Native provides a way to build mobile applications with a single codebase that can run on multiple platforms.

An important additional technology to consider with React Native is Solito which makes parallel development with next.js and react native simpler.
