## Introduction

C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming. C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.

## Features

- **Simple**: C++ is a simple language in the sense that it provides a structured approach (to break the problem into parts), and it is a rich set of library functions.

## Compilers

As a compiled language, C++ must be compiled before it can be executed. The following are some of the most popular C++ compilers:
